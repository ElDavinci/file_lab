Create a java application called FileIOExample. The application should read all required information from two
input files file1.txt and file2.txt, concatenate the information, and write the output to a single output file file1-
file2.txt. The first file (file1.txt) contains a list of First names, and the second file (file2.txt) contains a list of Last
names. Note that both input files have the same number of lines. After writing to the output file, you need to
display the occurrences of each letter in both files. Note that letters are case-insensitive.
In this task, you will do the following:
-Read the first name from the first input file and the last name from the second input file
-Concatenate the first name and last name and write it on a single line to the output file.
-Display the number of occurrences of each letter in the output file in alphabetic order.


## Learning outcomes
• File Processing using the File class <br>
• Discovering file/directory properties, to delete and rename files/ directories, to create directories using the
File class <br>
• Read /write data from/to a file using the Scanner/PrintWriter class <br>

## how to run
(1) clone repo <br>
(2) open src -> App.java  in vscode (preferably)<br>
(3) run the code <br>
Simple huh :0
